Biography
Background
A British National who fought in the Second World War as a Royal Marine Commando, and also was Royal Navy boxing champion. After the war was over, he moved to Los Angeles and continued a career in boxing with Carlo Arquero as his manager, and Candy Edwards as his girlfriend.

Arquero deemed Hammond as a ""washed up"" fighter with his career going nowhere. Mickey Cohen would later urge Arquero to force Hammond to take a dive in his upcoming fight with Kid Galahad. Rumors of this outcome would spread causing a prize win racket, profiting off Hammond's loss in the fight. Hammond resented being used and decided to go against Arquero's wishes. Hammond placed bets on himself throughout various bookmakers, he calculated the odds and his winnings would sum up to over $11,000.

Events of L.A. Noire
During the fight with Kid Galahad, Hammond pretended to be losing the fight, but ultimately won with a knockout, inciting the outrage of the many spectators who lost their bets. Hammond immediately went to his locker room, climbed through the window and made a run, realizing that a hit would be placed on his head for not taking the fall. While in hiding, Hammond simply allowed Candy to take the betting slips to the bookmakers to collect his winnings. Hammond was able to covertly collect the winnings off Candy at the bus terminal but she was then murdered by Arquero.

Arquero confronted Hammond at the Egyptian Theater. Hammond chastised Arquero for killing Candy and for using him. Arquero attempted to kill Hammond and take the winnings, however, Arquero was killed in a gunfight with arrival of Cole Phelps and Roy Earle. Phelps empathized with Hammond's notions of courage as a marine, hence allowed him a chance to leave L.A. with the winnings but warned him not to return for his own safety.",L.A.
